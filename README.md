Neighbourhood Map Project

This project makes use of the Google Maps API, along with the Wikipedia API, to display information about a map through markers with correspondent infowindows. There is a list of the places listed as well as a filter option (dropdown menu).

To open the project, simply clone/download the github repo and open it in your machine. Explore Marrickville, a hipster town in Sydney, Australia, simple as that!

The project uses Knockout.js framework as an organizational framework, as well as jQuery and Bootstrap for responsiveness and styling.
